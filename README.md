This is the developer-focused part of Spree Commerce documentation. Here you will find all kinds of information on topics such as Customization, Deployment, Configuration, and inside knowledge on how Spree works under the hood.

For API reference please visit the [API portal](https://api.spreecommerce.org).

If you're interested in contributing to the Spree core codebase, check out the [Developing Spree](contributing/developing\_spree.md) page. Otherwise, if you'd like to get your own Spree app set up, continue to the Getting Started section.

Happy coding!
